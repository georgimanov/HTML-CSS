                Last fall, work on my coding side projects came to a head: I wasn’t making adequate progress and I
                couldn’t
                find a
                way to get more done without sacrificing my ability to do effective work at Khan Academy. There were a
                few
                major
                problems with how I was working on my side projects. I was [...]

                First, some background: I highly recommend that you read the following two blog posts: by Ashe Dryden:
                The
                Ethics of
                Unpaid Labor and the OSS Community and by James Coglan: Why Github is not your CV. They make some
                fantastic
                points
                and communicate the issues surrounding “Using Github as your CV”. Both of these were [...]

                This summer I had the opportunity to attend NodeConf and it was a fantastic experience. I really
                appreciated
                how
                every session was a hands-on coding session: I felt like I walked away knowing how to put a bunch of
                advice
                directly
                into practice. One of my favorite sessions was the one run by James Halliday [...]
